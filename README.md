# YouTube_Download.py
A Youtube video/audio downloader made with python and pytube

## How to use
- Install python from python.org
- Install pytube using the pip package panager
- Run the python file

## Why is there yet another youtube downloader on the internet?
I wanted mine to support both audio and video, have a small fie size and open-source, and I am too lazy to find a better one on github

## I am getting error(s)
- Make sure the url is correct and try to include https
- Search errors related to pip/python/pytube
- Or maybe it's because pytube has recieved a new change which does not make this one work and I did not update the code
